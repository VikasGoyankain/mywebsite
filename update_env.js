/**
 * Instructions for updating Vercel Environment Variables
 * 
 * The subscribers page is not working in production because the environment variables
 * are not properly configured in Vercel. Here's how to fix it:
 * 
 * 1. Log in to the Vercel dashboard (https://vercel.com)
 * 2. Select your project
 * 3. Go to "Settings" > "Environment Variables"
 * 4. Add the following environment variables:
 *    - ADMIN_API_KEY: admin-secret-key-12345
 *    - NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_API_KEY: admin-secret-key-12345
 * 
 * 5. Once added, redeploy your application:
 *    - Go to "Deployments" tab
 *    - Find your latest deployment
 *    - Click the three dots menu and select "Redeploy"
 * 
 * Alternatively, you can use the Vercel CLI:
 * 
 * ```
 * # Install Vercel CLI if you haven't
 * npm install -g vercel
 * 
 * # Login
 * vercel login
 * 
 * # Add environment variables
 * vercel env add ADMIN_API_KEY
 * vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_API_KEY
 * 
 * # Deploy with environment variables
 * vercel --prod
 * ```
 * 
 * NOTE: We've also added failsafes in the code that will use a hardcoded API key
 * when the environment variables are not available. This is not a secure approach
 * for a production environment, but it will allow the application to work in the 
 * short term while you configure the environment variables properly.
